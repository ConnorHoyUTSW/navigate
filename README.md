ASLM Python Project


Continuous Integration
------------

Includes functionality from Auto-Docker for remote building and testing of Docker images from a Docker build file (Dockerfile) and a unit test file (unittest.yml). Allows users to build, test and maintain Docker images outside of firewalls, proxies and machine limitations. Additionally, it is a storage repository, and can act as a functional archive and version control for all your Dockerfile recipes (though not the images themselves). Pipeline was developed by BICF from funding provided by **Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (RP150596)**.
